Objectives:

To establish if there is a difference in initial earning potential for different degrees within the US, focusing esepecially on the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The university is ranked 25th in the world and classifies as an Ivy League institution in the United States. 

We are investigating on the behalf of a graduate recruitment agency who are looking to maximise profit by placing University of Wisconsin graduates in positions making the highest possible initial salary. The recruitment agency would like to understand if they should screen graduates based on their degree type in an effort to maximise the probability of getting them hired into high earning positions. 


Hypotheses:

(1) Do graduates with STEM degrees earn significantly higher starting salaries than graduates with Humanities degrees?

(2) Does college Type does not affect your start salary and salary increase in mid career. 

(3) Do STEM students have a statistical difference in the the number of A grades when compared to the Humanities at the Univeristy of Wisconsin, Madison?

Findings:
(1) STEM degree graduates earn on average $13,000 more than Humanities gradutes.
(2) State school graduates earn the least on average in terms of starting salary and show the smallest increase to mid career salary in comparison to other types of institutions.
(3) Yes there is a statsitcally significant increase in the number of students earning A grades in STEM fields when compared to that of Humanities.
