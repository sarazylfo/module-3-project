Objectives:

To establish if there is a difference in initial earning potential for different degrees within the US, focusing esepecially on the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The university is ranked 25th in the world and classifies as an Ivy League institution in the United States. 

We are investigating on the behalf of a graduate recruitment agency who are looking to maximise profit by placing University of Wisconsin graduates in positions making the highest possible initial salary. The recruitment agency would like to understand if they should screen graduates based on their degree type in an effort to maximise the probability of getting them hired into high earning positions. 


Hypotheses:

Do graduates with STEM degrees earn significantly higher starting salaries than graduates with Humanities degrees?

Do graduates from the University of Wisconsin, Madison earn significantly higher starting salaries in comparison to graduates form other United States Universities?

Do STEM students have a statistical difference in the the number of A grades when compared to the Humanities?
